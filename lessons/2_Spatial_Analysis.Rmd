## Spatial Queries

-   Spatial queries enable users to explore and map datasets, leading to intricate models and visualizations of real-world features and phenomena not immediately evident in spatial datasets.

-   Spatial queries are a fundamental aspect of spatial analysis that allow for calculations and data subsetting based on spatial relationships between different datasets and geometries, as long as they share geographic space.

-   These relationships operations, like proximity and intersection, play a key role in the analytical process through creating and extracting data metrics and insightful data subsets.

### Spatial Measurement Queries

Measurement queries involve calculations such as distances, areas, and other geometric properties to provide insights into the spatial relationships within a dataset(s).

Ask question like

-   What is feature A's **length**?
    -   What is the length of the BART train line between Walnut Creek and Rockridge?
-   What is feature A's **distance** from feature B?
    -   What is the distance between Berkeley High School and Berkeley BART Station?
-   What is feature A's **area**?
    -   What is the area of Alameda County?

[Load the libraries]{.underline}

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)

```

[Read in the CA Counties data]{.underline}

```{r}

# Read in the counties shapefile
counties = st_read(dsn = here("data", 
                              "california_counties", 
                              "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

#fix any potential issues with the counties geometry
counties <- st_make_valid(counties)

#avisualize the geometry
plot(counties$geometry)
```

```{r}

#review the contents of the dataframe
head(counties,2)
```

#### Measurement Queries: Units

When conducting measurement queries, it's essential to have consistent units to ensure accurate and meaningful analyses.

Let's start by looking at the different ways units can be expressed and different aspects of spatial data that influence units.

Lets start by selecting data pertaining only to Alameda County and save it to a new spatial dataframe.

\*\* Note that this is an **attribute query** which involves selecting or filtering data based on specific attributes or properties within a dataset

[select only data pertaining to Alameda county]{.underline}

```{r}

#using $ to select for when the NAME column has 'Alameda' as an entry
alameda = counties[counties$NAME=='Alameda',]

#plot the Alameda county geometry
plot(alameda$geometry)
```

A measurement query is similar, but more expansive in that it allow users to subset data and create new relationships based on spatial metrics and calculations (e.g. distances, areas)

We'll start off with some simple measurement queries. Let's first calculate the area of Alameda county using the `st_area()` function.

[Get the area of Alameda County with the`sf` function `st_area`]{.underline}

```{r}

#use the st_area function to get the area of Alameda county
st_area(alameda)
```

This gives the area of the county in square meters. CRS' generally have specific units associated with them.

`sf` uses the `units` package to manage (get and set) units.

It's more useful to return the area of large regions in square KM (or sq miles) and we can do that with the `set_units()` function.

[convert the default units]{.underline}

```{r}

#use the set_units and st_area functions to calculate are and convert the are to km^2 units
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: manual unit conversions (e.g. dividing m^2^ by 10^6^ to get km^2^) using the `sf` package don't translate well - converted values may still be reported as m2.

Now you try it!

Calculate the area of Alameda County in sq miles.

-   What should you change `km^2` to?
-   Hint: you can take a look at [Measurement units in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/measurement_units_in_R.html) to get a sense of more units

```{r}

#set the area units to square miles
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), mi^2)  ## WHAT SHOULD YOU CHANGE IT TO?
```

Always check your measurements.

It's a good idea to check one or two measurements before you automate your workflow to make sure you are getting valid values. If we look up the area of Alameda county on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California) (last edited on 7 December 2023) we get 821 sq mi (2130 km2).

üîî **Question**: Are the values returned by `st_area()` valid? Why might they differ?

We can also use `st_area()` to add the area of all counties to the spatial dataframe.

[Create a new column in the existing dataframe containing the area of the counties]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a new column that contains the area in Km^2 for the NAD83 CRS
counties$areakm2_NAD83 <- units::set_units(st_area(counties), km^2)

# take a look at the added column
head(counties)
```

Spatial measurements are greatly dependent on the coordinate reference system (CRS). They can differ greatly depending on the CRS. Let's take a look at the areas in different CRS's using a script with multiple functions.

[Examine the areas using different CRS's]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a new column for each version of the area: 

# Calculate area using data in WGS84 CRS (4326)
counties$areakm2_wgs84 <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,4326)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in UTM NAD83 zone 10 CRS (26910)
counties$areakm2_utm <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,26910)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in Web Mercator CRS (3857)
counties$areakm2_web <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 3857)), km^2)

# Take a look at a subset of the Name and area columns only
head(counties[,c('NAME','areakm2_NAD83','areakm2_wgs84','areakm2_utm','areakm2_web')])

```

Output Interpretation:

-   **NAD83 / CA Albers:** The source data's CRS, CA Albers, is optimized for accurate area measurements within California. Values in the **`area_km2`** column are highly precise, assuming accurate underlying geometry.

-   **WGS84:** Computing areas in WGS84 (a geographic CRS with decimal degrees) yields almost identical values. Modern versions of the **`sf`** package use spherical geometry for precise area computations, even in geographic data.

-   **UTM10:** This CRS is optimized for Northern California, making it less accurate as you move away from the zone's center (e.g., Southern California).

-   **Web Mercator:** While preserving shape, Web Mercator significantly distorts area. It's unsuitable for precise area calculations.

The important takeaway is that you need to use a CRS that is appropriate for your analysis/mapping needs!

When creating a spatial analysis work flow it is common to start by transforming all of your data to the same, appropriate CRS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can use the `st_length()` operator in the same way as `st_area()` to calculate the length of features in a spatial dataframe. Always take note of the output units!

Let's determine how many miles of metro lines there are using Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) data

[Read in the BART lines data]{.underline}

```{r}

#read in the BART lines data into a new variable
bart_lines <- st_read(here('data', 'transportation', 'bart_lines_2019.geojson'))  #note the different file type

#data source: https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/stanford-mh686mh0418
```

üîî **Question**: what is a quick way to visualize the geospatial data we just read in?

```{r}

#create a quick plot of the bart_lines geometry
plot(bart_lines$geometry)
```

üîî **Question**: what type of geometry do you think the bart_lines data is?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü•ä Challenge 1: Examine and modify length measurements

Similar to the `st_area()` function, the `st_length()` allows you to determine the length of a line geometry.

-   Create new columns called `len_mi`, `len_km`, and `len_m` that contain the length of the bartlines geometry in miles, kilometers, and meters respectfully.

-   Create new columns called len_NAD83, len_WebMarc, and len_WGS84 that contain the length of the bartlines geometry in the NAD83, Web Mercator, and WGS84 CRS's. (search previous text for the respective EPSG codes if needed).

[Examine lengths using different units]{.underline}

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

[Examine lengths using different CRS's]{.underline}

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Measurement Queries: Distance

The `st_distance()` function can be used to find the distance between two geometries or two sets of geometries. Let's compute the distance between two schools.

[load in the data]{.underline}

```{r}

# Read in the school_sf shapefile
schools_sf = st_read(dsn =here("data",
                               "California_Schools_2019-20",
                               "SchoolSites1920.shp"))
```

```{r}

#read more about the distance function
?st_distance

colnames(schools_sf) #identify the column name containg the name of the schools
```

[compute the distance between two points]{.underline}

```{r}

#determine the distance between Alameda and Berkeley high
st_distance(schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Alameda High',], 
                          schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',])
```

You can also use `st_distance()` to find the distance between multiple features

[compute the distance between features in different datasets]{.underline}

```{r}

# tranform the CRS' to match using 2 methods
schools_utm10 <- st_transform(schools_sf, 26910) #assign the CRS based on the EPSG code
bart_lines_utm10 = st_transform(bart_lines, st_crs(schools_utm10 )) #assign the CRS based on the first dataset

View(bart_lines_utm10) #note that there are 6 bart line segments
```

```{r}

#calculate the distance between Berkeley High and each portion of the BART line
st_distance(schools_utm10[schools_utm10$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',], bart_lines_utm10)

```

Note the format of the output. The `st_distance()` calculates the distance from the point location of the school and each segment of the BART lines

üîî **Question**: since the dataframe itself does not contain explicit information about the 6 BART lines, how can one better understand the data?

-   Metadata, including those sometimes contained with the shapefiles may provide additional information.

There are different ways to determine which section of the BART lines to calculate the distance to, for instance, to the nearest point of the line geometry, which depend on the goal of the analysis. See the `?st_distance()` documentation for more details.

Measurement queries focus more on distance, area, etc. relationships between geometrys. Relationship queries relate elements of two geometries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spatial Relationship Queries

[Spatial relationship queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) consider how two geometries or sets of geometries relate to one another in space.

relationship queries ask questions like:

-   Is feature A **within** feature B?
    -   *What schools are in the city of Berkeley?*
-   Does feature A **intersect** with feature B?
    -   In which cities are Tilden Regional Park located?
-   Does feature A **cross** feature B?
    -   *Does the BART train line cross into Albany?*

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png){height="300px"}

These can be used to select features in one dataset based on their spatial relationship to another.

Let's take a look at a few relationship queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Spatial Intersections

Geometry A spatially intersects Geometry B if any of its parts (e.g., a point, line segment, or polygon) is equivalent to, touches, crosses, is contained by, contains, or overlaps any part of Geometry B.

This is the most general of all spatial relationships!

The `st_intersects()` function is used to determine intersections, and can be used to specify explicit relationships (e.g. touches) by setting the operation or `op=()` argument to any of the options listed in the `?st_intersects` help documentation (e.g. `st_touches`, `st_crosses`).

[view help documentation]{.underline}

```{r}

#see the various options similar to intersects. See the Usage section
?st_intersects
```

Let's examine a spatial intersection by determining how continuation schools intersect Alameda county

[determine specific school that intersect one county]{.underline}

```{r}

#convert the counties dataframe into the utm10 CRS
counties_utm10 = st_transform(counties, st_crs(schools_utm10 ))
```

```{r}

#subset only the schools in Alameda county
Alameda_county_utm10 <- counties_utm10[counties_utm10$NAME =="Alameda", ]
```

```{r}

#subset only the Continuing education schools
Continuation_schools_utm10 <- schools_utm10[schools_utm10$SchoolType == "Continuation", ]

#determine the number of continuing education schools there are
nrow(Continuation_schools_utm10)


#more info on Continuation schools: https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/eo/ce/
```

[use `st_intersects` to determine the intersection]{.underline}

```{r}


# select only the continuing education schools that intersect Alameda county
Continuation_Alameda_utm10 <- Continuation_schools_utm10[Alameda_county_utm10, ,op=st_intersects]

#determine how many schools there are that meet the criteria and view the data on these schools
nrow(Continuation_Alameda_utm10)
head(Continuation_Alameda_utm10)
```

The syntax we used was to

-   Select the features (i.e. rows) in the `Continuation_schools_utm10` dataframe

-   whose geometry **spatially intersects** the `Alameda_county_utm10` geometry

-   and keep all of the other `Continuation_schools_utm10` columns (all- because the extraction brackets have no second argument)

Let's create a quick plot to visualize what our selection returned

[visualize the intersecting schools]{.underline}

```{r}

# create a quick plot of the results the results

plot(Alameda_county_utm10$geometry, border="brown")
plot(Continuation_Alameda_utm10$geometry, col="red", add = T)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü•ä Challenge 2: Schools distance

Unlike the `st_intersects()` function, `st_disjoint()` subsets the features in A that do not share space with B. It selects the features that have no spatial intersection.

1.  Subset the counties data by selecting only `"Los Angeles"` in the `counties_utm10` county dataframe. Save this dataframe as `LA_county_utm10`

2.  Subset all the `"K-12"` schools in the `schools_utm10` dataframe. Save this dataframe as `"K_12_schools_utm10"`

3.  Select all K-12 Schools that do not share space with (e.g. NOT in) Los Angeles County

4.  On the same map, plot these schools in `"blue"`, the Los Angeles county boundary in `"purple"`, and add the Alameda county boundary in `"red"`. Using the `plot` function may be helpful.

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) is an `sf` cheatsheet that lists and briefly explains common relationship functions

![](images/sf_Cheatsheet.png)

Let's expand on our analyses by combining measurement and relationship queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Measurement and Relationship Queries Combined - Proximity Analyses

Measurement queries return a continuous value (e.g. area) while relationship queries evaluate to true or false, and then return the features for which the relationship is true. Let's take a look at a common analysis that combines those concepts: promiximity analysis.

Proximity analyses ask questions like

-   What schools in Berkeley are within 1/4 mile of a BART station?

Proximity analysis helps identify nearby features---to find all features within a certain maximum distance of features in another dataset

A common workflow for this type of analysis is:

1.  Buffer around the features in the reference dataset to create buffer polygons. (`st_buffer()`)

2.  Run a spatial relationship query to find all features that intersect (or are within) the buffer polygons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's conduct a proximity analysis to think through the concept of a walkable city. One aspect of a walkable city is that services (d.e public transportation) are accessible within a certain walk time.

Let's consider how 'walkable' Alameda county is by looking at the proximity of BART lines to continuing education schools.

[Plot the geometry]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot the bart_lines geometry using tmap
tm_shape(bart_lines_utm10) + 
  tm_lines(col = 'orange')
```

[Create a buffer]{.underline}

```{r}

#Create a buffer around the bart lines of 800 meters.
bart_lines_buf_utm10 = st_buffer(bart_lines_utm10, dist = 800)

#Note: the value is based on 5-10 minute walk = ~ 4-800 m

#one, somewhat arbitrary, publication on walkable cities: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667091722000188
```

[Visualize schools proximity to BART lines within Alameda county borders]{.underline}

```{r}

#plotting the BART lines 800m buffer and all schools within Alameda
bart_Alameda_plot <- tm_shape(Alameda_county_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
tm_shape(bart_lines_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() 

bart_Alameda_plot #creating a plot as a separate variable could make it easier to add to the plot
```

```{r}

#add the 800m bart lines buffer
bart_Alameda_buffer_plot <- bart_Alameda_plot + 
tm_shape(bart_lines_buf_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5)

bart_Alameda_buffer_plot
```

```{r}

#add the continuing education schools 
bart_Alameda_buffer_continuation_plot <- bart_Alameda_buffer_plot+
tm_shape(Continuation_Alameda_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2)

bart_Alameda_buffer_continuation_plot
```

Great! Looks like we're all ready to run our spatial relationship query to complete the proximity analysis. At this point (pun intended) we'll select the schools that are in within the BART line buffer polygons.

```{r}

#select the Continuation schools that intersect with the bart lines buffer
Continuation_Alameda_utm10_bart_buf <- Continuation_schools_utm10[bart_lines_buf_utm10, ,op=st_intersects]
```

Now let's overlay again, to see if the schools we selected make sense.

```{r}

# highlight the schools interrsect the BART line buffer in yellow
bart_Alameda_buffer_continuation_intersect_plot <- bart_Alameda_buffer_continuation_plot +  
tm_shape(Continuation_Alameda_utm10_bart_buf) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'yellow', size = 0.2) 
bart_Alameda_buffer_continuation_intersect_plot
```

The schools in yellow would be considered in a 'Walkable City' framework.

üîî **Question**: Take a break and think of other, similar analyses you could perform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proximity Analysis: Nearest Feature

We can can use `st_distance()` and its companion function `st_nearest_feature()` to compute the distance between each feature of A and the nearest feature in B (e.g. a middle school and the nearest high school).

[subset the schools dataframe]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a new dataframe that only contains schools in the Berkeley Unified school district, 
Berkeley_schools_utm10 <- schools_utm10[schools_utm10$DistrictNa == "Berkeley Unified", ]

#create a new dataframe that contains only the elementary schools in the district
Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 <- Berkeley_schools_utm10[Berkeley_schools_utm10$SchoolType  == "Elementary", ]

#create a new dataframe that contains only the middle schools in the district
Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10 <- Berkeley_schools_utm10[Berkeley_schools_utm10$SchoolType == "Middle", ]
```

[identify the nearest feature]{.underline}

```{r}

# for each elementary school, extract the ID of the nearest middle school
nearest_elementary_middle_school = st_nearest_feature(Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 , Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10)

# take a look!
nearest_elementary_middle_school
```

The output: the `st_nearest_feature` function returns the index or ID of the closest feature. These are stored in `nearest_elementary_middle_school`. We can use this index output to see the specific school

[View middle schools using index notation]{.underline}

```{r}

#View what the index output of the st_nearest_features refers to
Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10[1,]
```

[view syntax of st_nearest_feature function]{.underline}

```{r}

#see help info
?st_nearest_feature
```

We can view the full information of the nearest middle school using the fact that the output is an index.

```{r}

#extract the nearest middle school using indices 

#create a new column in the Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 dataframe called Closest_Middle_School 

View(Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10[nearest_elementary_middle_school,"SchoolName"])
```

Then we can use `st_distance()` to calculate the distance between each elementary school, and the nearest middle school. To do this, we will create a new column that stores the distance calculation:

[Determine the distance between the elementary school and the nearest middle school]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a new column in the Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 dataframe called elementary_middle_school_dist 

#use st_distance between each elementary school (Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10) and the closest middle school (Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10[nearest_elementary_middle_school,])

Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10$elementary_middle_school_dist <- st_distance(
  Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10,
  Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10[nearest_elementary_middle_school,], 
                                              by_element = TRUE)
#remember that nearest_elementary_middle_school is an index that specifies the nearest middle school, which is why we can use it in bracket notation. 

#extract just the school name and the distance
Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10[, c("SchoolName","elementary_middle_school_dist")]
                                  
# can order the data
#Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10[order(Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10$elementary_middle_school_dist),]

```

Note that although we only selected the two columns, the geometry columns came along.

This is one nuanced example of the many of the ways we can work with spatial queries. Use this as an example of what is possible.

# Key Points

-   Thematic maps emphasize the geographic distribution and relationships of data that are not easily discernible using standard plots (like barplots)
-   There are different packages that allow you to visualize geospatial data, using the `plot()` function, or the `tmap` or `ggplot2` packages. Each has different eases of use and different benefits.
-   Understanding your data and knowing what aspects you want to emphasize enables you to utilize different color palettes and transformations to emphasize key aspects of the geographic distribution of the data.
-   Changing the way in which the different shades and colors of a thematic map are associated with data, via binning the data using different classification schemes, enhances the type of information that can be conveyed.
-   Measurement queries involve calculating areas (`st_area() )`,and other geometric properties (`st_length() )` within spatial datasets. We looked at this, for instance, through using **`st_distance()`** to find distances between schools and transportation lines.
-   Relationship queries allow you to analyze how sets of geometries relate to each other in space. We used `st_intersect()` and `st_disjoint()` to look at schools within or outside a county.
-   Proximity analysis allows us to find nearby features (`st_nearest_feature() )` within a certain distance, like identifying schools within a certain distance of transportation lines using buffers (`st_buffer()`)
